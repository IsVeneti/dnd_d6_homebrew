# DnD d6 Homebrew
DnD d6 Homebrew is an android application that can be used in homebrew dnd, using custom d6 dice instead of the regular
ones used in dnd, determining damage, range, healing and shielding (defence). 

## How to play
To use in a DnD game, the hitpoints of the player characters (PC) as well as the enemies 
need to be adjusted, since the damage output of the dice is too low for the regular DnD hitpoints.
